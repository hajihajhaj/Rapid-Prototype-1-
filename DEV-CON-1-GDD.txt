Define the desired game mechanic or feature. What are you making? 
A 2D platformer with two paths: one below and one above. At the end of the lower path, there is a teleporter that takes you to the upper path. While on the first path, you can see the path above.

Outline an objective statement for the design. What question are you trying to answer with your prototype? Why?
The objective of this prototype is to test the engaging effects of seeing the upcoming level while playing through the first half. We aim to see in what ways this engages players to think ahead while navigating the current sets of platforms. This prototype will also help to test the benefits players feel when foreseeing upcoming challenges or obstacles and if this how rewarding this feels for the player as they attempt to memorize what will come in the second half of the level.

Detail design rationale. What kind of experience do you envision? How is it innovative or experimental?
We envision players feeling curious and strategic while playing this game. Seeing the upper path while still on the lower encourages them to plan ahead and consider their next moves. Teleporting to the upper path introduces a new challenge, adding depth and balance to the gameplay. Players will feel rewarded for their planning and decision-making. This is innovative because most 2D platformers donâ€™t allow players to preview upcoming levels, making this experience unique and engaging.

Gameplay Overview:
What is the core gameplay loop (e.g., actions that players repeatedly perform)?


Target Audience:
Who is this game or mechanic designed for? (e.g., casual players, hardcore gamers)
This game is designed for both casual and hardcore players who enjoy a strategic challenge. The teleportation mechanic adds an extra layer of complexity, making players think about how to time their jumps and plan their next moves. Players must carefully jump over the teleporter without dying to succeed, which highlights the importance of timing. Additionally, the teleportation mechanics cater to both audiences by allowing players to easily access new areas, enhancing exploration.


Player Experience Goals:
What specific feelings, moods, or emotional responses do you want players to have?
We aim to make players feel excited and curious. After teleporting, we want them to be eager to explore the next level. The teleportation mechanic creates tension, requiring players to time their movements precisely to succeed. This challenge enhances the sense of reward when they achieve their goals. Overall, we want players to enjoy the game and feel a sense of accomplishment when they overcome obstacles.

Technical Requirements:
What tools, platforms, or engines will you use to create the prototype (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine)?
We will be using GameMaker, primarily GML Visual, to prototype our game. We will also incorporate code from previous assignments to help develop the teleportation mechanic and other core game features. We prefer this engine because it allows for rapid prototyping without having to know how to code. Its really simple to use and has great results.
